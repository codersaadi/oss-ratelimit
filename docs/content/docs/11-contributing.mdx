## Code Contributions

If you'd like to contribute code, please follow these steps:

<Steps>

<Step>
### 1. Prerequisites

*   **Node.js:** A recent LTS version (check `.nvmrc` if available).
*   **Package Manager:** We recommend using `pnpm` (`npm install -g pnpm`), but `npm` or `yarn` should also work.
*   **Git:** For version control.
*   **Redis:** A running Redis instance (local or remote) for testing.

<Callout type="warn" title="Local Redis">
You'll need a Redis server accessible for running the library and its tests. You can easily run one using Docker: `docker run -d --name oss-ratelimit-redis -p 6379:6379 redis`
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### 2. Fork & Clone

*   **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
*   **Clone** your fork locally:
    ```bash title="Clone your fork"
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/oss-ratelimit.git
    cd oss-ratelimit
    ```
*   Add the original repository as an upstream remote:
    ```bash title="Add upstream remote"
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/codersaadi/oss-ratelimit.git
    ```

</Step>

<Step>
### 3. Install Dependencies

Install project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash title="Install dependencies (using pnpm)"
pnpm install
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 4. Environment Setup

The library might require environment variables, especially for connecting to Redis during tests or development.

*   Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy `.env.example` if it exists).
*   Set the necessary variables, typically `RATELIMIT_REDIS_URL`:
    ```dotenv filename=".env"
    RATELIMIT_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
    # Add other variables if needed
    ```

</Step>

<Step>
### 5. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your changes, based on the `main` branch (or the relevant development branch). Use a descriptive name.

```bash title="Create a feature branch"
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream
git checkout upstream/main
git pull

# Create your branch
git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-name # or fix/your-bug-fix
```

</Step>

<Step>
### 6. Make Your Changes

*   Write your code, following the existing style and patterns.
*   Ensure your code is well-commented, especially for complex logic.
*   Add or update tests for your changes (see Testing section).
*   Update documentation (README, JSDoc, Fumadocs pages) if necessary.

</Step>

<Step>
### 7. Linting & Formatting

We use tools like ESLint, Prettier, or Biome to maintain code quality and consistency. Run the linting and formatting commands before committing.

```bash title="Check and fix code style"
# Check for linting errors (adjust command if needed)
pnpm lint

# Automatically format code (adjust command if needed)
pnpm format
```

<Callout>
Please ensure your code adheres to the project's linting and formatting rules. Commits might be blocked or CI checks might fail otherwise.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### 8. Testing

Ensure all existing tests pass, and add new tests to cover your changes.

```bash title="Run tests"
pnpm test
# Or specific test command if defined
```

<Callout type="info">
Contributions that include tests are much more likely to be accepted quickly. Tests ensure your changes work as expected and prevent regressions in the future.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### 9. Commit Your Changes

*   Stage your changes (`git add .`).
*   Commit them with a clear and descriptive message. We recommend following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
    ```bash title="Example Commit"
    git commit -m "feat: add token bucket algorithm support"
    # or
    git commit -m "fix: correct calculation in sliding window reset"
    # or
    git commit -m "docs: update contribution guidelines"
    ```

</Step>

<Step>
### 10. Push and Create Pull Request

*   Push your branch to your fork:
    ```bash title="Push to your fork"
    git push origin feature/your-descriptive-name
    ```
*   Go to the original `oss-ratelimit` repository on GitHub.
*   Click "New pull request" or respond to the prompt to create a PR from your recently pushed branch.
*   **Base Repository:** `codersaadi/oss-ratelimit` | **Base Branch:** `main` (or relevant dev branch)
*   **Head Repository:** `YOUR_USERNAME/oss-ratelimit` | **Compare Branch:** `feature/your-descriptive-name`
*   **Fill out the PR template:**
    *   Provide a clear title and description of your changes.
    *   Link to any relevant issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
    *   Explain the purpose of the changes and how you tested them.
*   Submit the Pull Request.

</Step>

<Step>
### 11. Code Review

*   The maintainer(s) will review your pull request.
*   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments based on feedback.
*   Once approved, your changes will be merged! ðŸŽ‰
