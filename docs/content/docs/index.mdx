`oss-ratelimit` is a feature-rich rate limiting library designed for performance and ease of use, heavily inspired by `@upstash/ratelimit`. It provides multiple algorithms, efficient Redis integration, fallback mechanisms, and a powerful registry system for managing multiple limiter configurations.

**Key Features:**

*   **Multiple Algorithms:** Fixed Window, Sliding Window, and Token Bucket.
*   **Redis Backend:** Leverages Redis for distributed, high-performance state management.
*   **Client Registry:** Efficiently manage multiple rate limiter instances and share Redis connections.
*   **Ephemeral Cache:** Optional in-memory fallback during Redis outages (currently for Sliding Window).
*   **Fail Open/Closed:** Configurable behavior during Redis failures.
*   **Analytics:** Optional tracking of request counts and throughput.
*   **TypeScript First:** Strongly typed for better developer experience.
*   **Next.js Ready:** Includes utilities and patterns for seamless integration (IP detection, middleware).
*   **Customizable:** Flexible configuration options for fine-tuning.
