## Ephemeral Cache

When `ephemeralCache: true` (the default), the library maintains a simple in-memory cache. If Redis becomes unavailable during a `.limit()` call for a **Sliding Window** limiter, it will fall back to this cache to provide *approximate* rate limiting.

<Callout type="warn" title="Limitations">
*   **Sliding Window Only:** Currently only works with the `slidingWindow` algorithm. Other algorithms will either throw an error or fail open if Redis fails, depending on `failOpen`.
*   **Not Distributed:** The cache is local to each process/instance. It won't work correctly for distributed systems behind a load balancer unless you implement sticky sessions (which often negates the benefit).
*   **Less Precise:** It provides basic counting within a window but lacks the precision and atomic guarantees of Redis.
*   **Memory Usage:** Stores counters in memory, potentially consuming more RAM under high load or with many unique identifiers.
</Callout>

It's primarily useful as a basic resilience mechanism for single-instance deployments or during brief Redis hiccups when using Sliding Window. For robust distributed systems, focus on Redis high availability.

## Analytics

Set `analytics: true` in the configuration to enable tracking of additional metrics.

When enabled, the `RatelimitResponse` from `.limit()` will include:

*   `pending`: (Approximation) The current number of requests counted within the window or tokens used (depends on algorithm).
*   `throughput`: (Approximation) Requests seen in the last second for the specific identifier (calculated via Redis ZCOUNT on a secondary key).

<Callout>
Enabling analytics adds a small overhead due to extra Redis commands (`ZADD`, `ZCOUNT`, `PEXPIRE` on the analytics key). Only enable it if you need these specific metrics per request.
