## Core Concepts

### Identifier

The `identifier` is a unique string used to track requests for a specific user, IP address, API key, or any other entity you want to rate limit. This is the primary argument passed to the `.limit()` method.

### Redis

Redis is used as the fast, distributed backend store for tracking request counts or tokens. `oss-ratelimit` uses efficient Lua scripts to perform atomic operations directly on the Redis server, minimizing latency and race conditions.

### Algorithms

`oss-ratelimit` provides several common rate limiting algorithms:

*   **Fixed Window:** Counts requests within discrete time windows (e.g., 10 requests per minute). Simple, but can allow bursts at window edges.
*   **Sliding Window:** Counts requests within a rolling time window. Smoother than Fixed Window, generally preferred for API rate limiting. More resource-intensive.
*   **Token Bucket:** Allows bursts based on accumulated tokens that refill over time. Good for throttling based on average rate while allowing occasional peaks.

Choose the algorithm that best suits your specific use case.


## Algorithms In Depth

<Tabs items={['Fixed Window', 'Sliding Window', 'Token Bucket']}>
  <Tab value="Fixed Window">
    <p>Counts requests within fixed, non-overlapping time intervals.</p>

    **Configuration:**
    ```typescript title="Fixed Window Example"
    import { fixedWindow } from 'oss-ratelimit';

    const fwLimiter = fixedWindow(
      100,    // Max 100 requests
      '1 h'   // Per hour window (windows reset on the hour)
    );
    ```

    **Use Case:** Simple limits like "max 5 login attempts per 15 minutes".

    **Pros:** Simple to understand and implement, lower Redis resource usage.
    **Cons:** Allows double the rate limit burst at the boundary between two windows.

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Sliding Window">
     <p>Counts requests within a rolling time window ending at the current request time. Provides smoother limiting.</p>

    **Configuration:**
    ```typescript title="Sliding Window Example"
    import { slidingWindow } from 'oss-ratelimit';

    const swLimiter = slidingWindow(
      20,    // Max 20 requests
      '10 s' // In any 10-second sliding period
    );
    ```

    **Use Case:** Common for API rate limiting (e.g., "max 1000 API calls per hour"). This is generally the recommended default for stateless services.

    **Pros:** Smoother rate limiting, prevents edge bursts seen in Fixed Window.
    **Cons:** More computationally expensive and uses more Redis memory (stores timestamps).

     <Callout type='info'>
        The Ephemeral Cache fallback mechanism currently only supports the Sliding Window algorithm.
     </Callout>

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Token Bucket">
    <p>Simulates a bucket holding tokens. Requests consume tokens, and the bucket refills at a constant rate. Allows for bursts up to the bucket's capacity.</p>

    **Configuration:**
    ```typescript title="Token Bucket Example"
    import { tokenBucket } from 'oss-ratelimit';

    const tbLimiter = tokenBucket(
      5,       // Refill 5 tokens...
      '1 m',   // ...every minute
      20       // Bucket capacity (max burst) is 20 tokens
    );
    ```

     **Use Case:** Throttling background jobs, controlling access to expensive operations, allowing bursts after periods of inactivity.

    **Pros:** Allows bursts, smooth average rate, decoupled refill and consumption.
    **Cons:** Slightly more complex state to manage (tokens + last refill time).
